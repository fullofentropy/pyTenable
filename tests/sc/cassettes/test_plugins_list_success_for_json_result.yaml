          the Virtuozzo installation on the\nremote host is affected by the following
          vulnerabilities :\n\n  - [x86 AMD] An industry-wide issue was found in the
          way\n    many modern microprocessor designs have implemented\n    speculative
          execution of Load & Store instructions (a\n    commonly used performance optimization).
          It relies on\n    the presence of a precisely-defined instruction\n    sequence
          in the privileged code as well as the fact\n    that memory read from address
          to which a recent memory\n    write has occurred may see an older value and\n    subsequently
          cause an update into the microprocessor''s\n    data cache even for speculatively
          executed instructions\n    that never actually commit (retire). As a result,
          an\n    unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read\n    privileged
          memory by conducting targeted cache\n    side-channel attacks.\n\n  - By mmap()ing
          a FUSE-backed file onto a process''s memory\n    containing command line arguments
          (or environment\n    strings), an attacker can cause utilities from psutils\n    or
          procps (such as ps, w) or any other program which\n    makes a read() call
          to the \/proc\/<pid>\/cmdline (or\n    \/proc\/<pid>\/environ) files to block
          indefinitely\n    (denial of service) or for some controlled time (as a\n    synchronization
          primitive for other attacks).\n\n  - A Floating Point Unit (FPU) state information
          leakage\n    flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel saved and\n    restored
          the FPU state during task switch. Linux\n    kernels that follow the ''Lazy
          FPU Restore'' scheme are\n    vulnerable to the FPU state information leakage
          issue.\n    An unprivileged local attacker could use this flaw to\n    read
          FPU state bits by conducting targeted cache\n    side-channel attacks, similar
          to the Meltdown\n    vulnerability disclosed earlier this year.\n\n  - A flaw
          was found in the way the Linux kernel handled\n    exceptions delivered after
          a stack switch operation via\n    Mov SS or Pop SS instructions. During the
          stack switch\n    operation, processor does not deliver interrupts and\n    exceptions,
          they are delivered once the first\n    instruction after the stack switch
          is executed. An\n    unprivileged system user could use this flaw to crash\n    the
          system kernel resulting in DoS. This CVE-2018-10872\n    was assigned due
          to regression of CVE-2018-8897.\n\nNote that Tenable Network Security has

          server and successfully logs in\n(anonymous or not), it asks the server for
          the current directory with\nthe `PWD` command. The server then responds with
          a 257 response\ncontaining the path, inside double quotes. The returned path
          name is\nthen kept by libcurl for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string\nparser

          to work with it - the PWD\ncommand is always issued on new FTP connections

          is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. The function\ncreating an

          header provided by the malicious or\nbroken HTTP server. Such a ''large value''
          needs to be around 1000 bytes\nor more. The actual payload data copied to
          the target buffer comes\nfrom the NTLMv2 type-2 response header.(CVE-2019-3822)\n\nlibcurl
          is vulnerable to a heap out-of-bounds read in the code\nhandling the end-of-response
          for SMTP. If the buffer passed to\n`smtp_endofresp()` isn''t NUL terminated
          and contains no character\nending the parsed number, and `len` is set to 5,
          then the `strtol()`\ncall reads beyond the allocated buffer. The read contents
          will not be\nreturned to the caller.(CVE-2019-3823)\n\nThe FTP wildcard function
          in curl and libcurl before 7.57.0 allows\nremote attackers to cause a denial
          of service (out-of-bounds read and\napplication crash) or possibly have unspecified
          other impact via a\nstring that ends with an ''['' character.(CVE-2017-8817)\n\nset_file_metadata
          in xattr.c in GNU Wget before 1.20.1 stores a file''s\norigin URL in the user.xdg.origin.url
          metadata attribute of the\nextended attributes of the downloaded file, which
          allows local users\nto obtain sensitive information (e.g., credentials contained
          in the\nURL) by reading this attribute, as demonstrated by getfattr. This
          also\napplies to Referer information in the user.xdg.referrer.url metadata\nattribute.
          According to 2016-07-22 in the Wget ChangeLog,\nuser.xdg.origin.url was partially
          based on the behavior of\nfwrite_xattr in tool_xattr.c in curl.(CVE-2018-20483)\n\nA
          buffer overrun flaw was found in the IMAP handler of libcurl. By\ntricking
          an unsuspecting user into connecting to a malicious IMAP\nserver, an attacker
          could exploit this flaw to potentially cause\ninformation disclosure or crash
          the application.(CVE-2017-1000257)\n\nA heap use-after-free flaw was found
          in curl versions from 7.59.0\nthrough 7.61.1 in the code related to closing
          an easy handle. When\nclosing and cleaning up an ''easy'' handle in the `Curl_close()`\nfunction,
          the library code first frees a struct (without nulling the\npointer) and might
          then subsequently erroneously write to a struct\nfield within that already
          freed struct.(CVE-2018-16840)\n\nCurl versions 7.33.0 through 7.61.1 are vulnerable
          to a buffer overrun\nin the SASL authentication code that may lead to denial
          of\nservice.(CVE-2018-16839)"},{"id":"122261","name":"Amazon Linux 2 : systemd

          SLES15 Security Update : dovecot23 (SUSE-SU-2019:0414-1)","description":"This
          update for dovecot23 fixes the following issues :\n\ndovecot was updated to
          2.3.3 release, bringing lots of bugfixes\n(bsc#1124356).\n\nAlso the following
          security issue was fixed :\n\nCVE-2019-3814: A vulnerability in Dovecot related
          to SSL client\ncertificate authentication was fixed (bsc#1123022)\n\nThe package
          changes :\n\nUpdated pigeonhole to 0.5.3: Fix assertion panic occurring when\nmanagesieve
          service fails to open INBOX while saving a Sieve script.\nThis was caused
          by a lack of cleanup after failure.\n\nFix specific messages causing an assert
          panic with actions that\ncompose a reply (e.g. vacation). With some rather
          weird input from the\noriginal message, the header folding algorithm (as used
          for composing\nthe References header for the reply) got confused, causing
          the panic.\n\nIMAP FILTER=SIEVE capability: Fix FILTER SIEVE SCRIPT command
          parsing.\nAfter finishing reading the Sieve script, the command parsing\nsometimes
          didn''t continue with the search arguments. This is a time-\ncritical bug
          that likely only occurs when the Sieve script is sent in\nthe next TCP frame.\n\ndovecot23
          was updated to 2.3.3: doveconf hides more secrets now in the\ndefault output.\n\nssl_dh
          setting is no longer enforced at startup. If it''s not set and\nnon-ECC DH
          key exchange happens, error is logged and client is\ndisconnected.\n\nAdded
          log_debug=<filter> setting. <\/filter>\n\nAdded log_core_filter=<log filter>
          setting. <\/log>\n\nquota-clone: Write to dict asynchronously\n\n--enable-hardening
          attempts to use retpoline Spectre 2 mitigations\n\nlmtp proxy: Support source_ip
          passdb extra field.\n\ndoveadm stats dump: Support more fields and output
          stddev by default.\n\npush-notification: Add SSL support for OX backend.\n\nNUL
          bytes in mail headers can cause truncated replies when fetched.\n\ndirector:
          Conflicting host up\/down state changes may in some rare\nsituations ended
          up in a loop of two directors constantly overwriting\neach others'' changes.\n\ndirector:
          Fix hang\/crash when multiple doveadm commands are being\nhandled concurrently.\n\ndirector:
          Fix assert-crash if doveadm disconnects too early\n\nvirtual plugin: Some
          searches used 100% CPU for many seconds\n\ndsync assert-crashed with acl plugin
          in some situations. (bsc#1119850)\n\nmail_attachment_detection_options=add-flags-on-save
          assert-crashed\nwith some specific Sieve scripts.\n\nMail snippet generation
          crashed with mails containing invalid\nContent-Type:multipart header.\n\nLog
          prefix ordering was different for some log lines.\n\nquota: With noenforcing
          option current quota usage wasn''t updated.\n\nauth: Kerberos authentication
          against Samba assert-crashed.\n\nstats clients were unnecessarily chatty with
          the stats server.\n\nimapc: Fixed various assert-crashes when reconnecting
          to server.\n\nlmtp, submission: Fix potential crash if client disconnects
          while\nhandling a command.\n\nquota: Fixed compiling with glibc-2.26 \/ support
          libtirpc.\n\nfts-solr: Empty search values resulted in 400 Bad Request errors\n\nfts-solr:
          default_ns parameter couldn''t be used\n\nsubmission server crashed if relay
          server returned over 7 lines in a\nreply (e.g. to EHLO)\n\ndovecot was updated
          to 2.3.2.1: SSL\/TLS servers may have crashed\nduring client disconnection\n\nlmtp:
          With lmtp_rcpt_check_quota=yes mail deliveries may have\nsometimes assert-crashed.\n\nv2.3.2:
          ''make check'' may have crashed with 32bit systems\n\ndovecot was updated
          to 2.3.2: old-stats plugin: Don''t temporarily\nenable PR_SET_DUMPABLE while
          opening \/proc\/self\/io. This may still\ncause security problems if the process
          is ptrace()d at the same time.\nInstead, open it while still running as root.\n\ndoveadm:
          Added mailbox cache decision&remove commands. See\ndoveadm-mailbox(1) man
          page for details.\n\ndoveadm: Added rebuild attachments command for rebuilding\n$HasAttachment
          or $HasNoAttachment flags for matching mails. See\ndoveadm-rebuild(1) man
          page for details.\n\ncassandra: Use fallback_consistency on more types of
          errors\n\nlmtp proxy: Support outgoing SSL\/TLS connections\n\nlmtp: Add lmtp_rawlog_dir
          and lmtp_proxy_rawlog_dir settings.\n\nsubmission: Add support for rawlog_dir\n\nsubmission:
          Add submission_client_workarounds setting.\n\nlua auth: Add password_verify()
          function and additional fields in auth\nrequest.\n\ndoveadm-server: TCP connections
